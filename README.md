Rostam: Legend of Persia
About The Project
Rostam: Legend of Persia is an action roguelike game that reimagines the epic tales of the Shahnameh through modern game design. Players embody Rostam, the legendary hero of Persian mythology, as he undertakes his famous seven trials (Haft Khan) in a challenging, procedurally generated world inspired by Persian mythology and art.
Game Overview
In this fresh take on the classic Persian epic, each run represents one of Rostam's legendary trials, reimagined through roguelike mechanics. Players will experience the grand scale of Persian mythology while mastering deep combat mechanics and discovering powerful artifacts from the Shahnameh.

Mythological Companion: Fight alongside Rakhsh, Rostam's mighty steed, switching between mounted and ground combat
Persian Mythology: Encounter characters, creatures, and locations from the Shahnameh, brought to life through gameplay
Roguelike Progression: Each attempt at the trials brings new challenges and opportunities, with permanent upgrades reflecting Rostam's growing legend
Artistic Vision: Visual style inspired by Persian miniature paintings, blending traditional art with modern game aesthetics

Inspiration
The game draws inspiration from both the timeless narrative of the Shahnameh and modern roguelike games such as Hades and Mark of the Deep, creating a unique blend of Persian mythology and contemporary game design.
The Shahnameh Connection
The Shahnameh, or Book of Kings, is a monumental epic poem written by Ferdowsi around 1000 CE. Our game focuses on Rostam, its greatest hero, reimagining his legendary deeds through the lens of modern gameplay. This adaptation aims to introduce these incredible stories to a new audience while honoring their cultural significance.
